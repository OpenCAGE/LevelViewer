A 3D companion to OpenCAGE's Commands Editor. The two tools should be used alongside eachother: enable the Level Viewer connection in the script editor to start a websocket between them.

Changes made in the script editor will be reflected in the Unity scene.

This tool is included in [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE)! Read more about the setup process [here](http://opencage.co.uk/docs/level-viewer).
