A work-in-progress project to build a 3D companion to [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE/)'s Commands Editor.

## How to use

- Within the [Commands editor](https://github.com/OpenCAGE/CommandsEditor) (included in OpenCAGE), enable the "Connect to Unity" option.
- Clone this project and open it in [Unity 2022.3.9f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.9). It should auto-play, which may take some time to load.

Composites loaded in the Commands editor will populate within the Unity Editor, allowing you to locate transforms easily within the environment. Please note that any changes within the Commands editor will only be reflected when you stop and start the Unity Editor's play mode.

This tool will eventually become a part of [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE), but for now it exists in its own repo until it is more feature complete.
