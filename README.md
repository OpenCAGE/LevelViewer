<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nCdoJYj.png" width="100%">

A 3D companion to OpenCAGE's Commands Editor. The two tools should be used alongside eachother: enable the Level Viewer connection in the script editor to start a websocket between them.

This tool is a part of [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE)!
