A work-in-progress project to build a 3D companion to OpenCAGE's Commands Editor. The two tools should be used alongside eachother: enable the Unity connection to start a websocket between them.

Composites loaded in the Commands editor will populate within the Unity Editor whilst this project is open, allowing you to locate transforms easily within the environment.

This tool will eventually become a part of [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE), but for now it exists in its own repo until it is more feature complete.
